# Pulse — macOS menu-bar app

A native Swift app that always shows the same info as the VSCode extension (5-hour / weekly usage + current model) in the **macOS menu bar (top right)**.

The menu bar shows only a gauge icon + compact usage (to blend in with the neighboring CPU/memory/network icons):

```
◐ 5% · 4%      (5h % · weekly %)
```

Clicking it opens a dropdown with details (time remaining until reset, weekly Opus/Sonnet, current model, last update) plus `Refresh Now` / `Quit`. When usage is high, the menu-bar text color turns orange (80%+) / red (95%+).

> **Menu-bar only** — because of `LSUIElement` / `.accessory`, no Dock icon appears.

## How it works

It uses the same source as the VSCode extension (ported to Swift):

- Usage: `https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`
- Token: `~/.claude/.credentials.json` → macOS keychain if absent
- Current model: the last `message.model` from the most recent transcript among `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`

## Build & run

```bash
# 1) Make a double-clickable .app (recommended)
./build-app.sh
open ./Pulse.app          # or double-click in Finder

# 2) Run directly from the terminal
swift build -c release
./.build/release/Pulse

# Print the values once (no menu bar)
./.build/release/Pulse --once
```

To quit: click the menu-bar icon → `Quit` (or `pkill -f Pulse`).

## Distribution (signing & notarization)

> See [docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) for the full pre-deployment checklist and the
> security-review summary.

`./build-app.sh` alone produces an **ad-hoc signed** app — fine for your own machine, but
Gatekeeper blocks it on anyone else's. To distribute, sign with a Developer ID certificate
and notarize. Once set up, `release.sh` does the whole thing in one command:

```bash
CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./release.sh
# → Pulse-<version>.dmg, notarized + stapled, ready to hand out
```

Under the hood that runs:

```bash
# 1) Sign (hardened runtime + entitlements, done by build-app.sh)
CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./build-app.sh

# 2) Notarize and staple the app
ditto -c -k --keepParent Pulse.app Pulse.zip
xcrun notarytool submit Pulse.zip --keychain-profile <profile> --wait
xcrun stapler staple Pulse.app

# 3) Verify
spctl --assess --type execute Pulse.app
```

`Pulse.entitlements` grants `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events`, which the
"Log In via Claude Code" menu item needs to open Terminal under the hardened runtime
(macOS will still ask the user for Automation permission on first use).

## Security & privacy

- **What it reads:** the Claude Code OAuth access token (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`,
  falling back to the `Claude Code-credentials` keychain item) and, to show the current
  model, the local transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` — only the
  `message.model` field is used; conversation content is never displayed or transmitted.
- **Where data goes:** the token is sent only to `https://api.anthropic.com` to fetch
  usage. Nothing else leaves your machine; there is no analytics or telemetry.
- **What it stores:** nothing. The token stays in memory and is re-read on every poll.
- **Heads-up:** the usage endpoint (`/api/oauth/usage`) is an undocumented Claude Code
  internal API and may change or stop working without notice.
- **Affiliation:** Pulse is an independent product, not affiliated with or endorsed by
  Anthropic. Claude is a trademark of Anthropic, PBC.

## Settings / fine-tuning

The two-line display is drawn into an image sized to the menu-bar height. If the line positions do not align with neighboring items, adjust the values below.

| Setting | Env var | `defaults` key | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| Refresh interval (seconds) | `CLAUDE_USAGE_INTERVAL` | `Interval` | 300 |
| Font size | `CLAUDE_USAGE_FONT_SIZE` | `FontSize` | 9 |
| Font weight | `CLAUDE_USAGE_FONT_WEIGHT` | `FontWeight` | 0.4 (bold) |
| Line gap (center-to-center) | `CLAUDE_USAGE_LINE_GAP` | `LineGap` | 10 |
| Overall vertical shift (+up / −down) | `CLAUDE_USAGE_Y_OFFSET` | `YOffset` | 0 |

**When running from the terminal** — use env vars:
```bash
CLAUDE_USAGE_LINE_GAP=12 CLAUDE_USAGE_FONT_SIZE=9 ./.build/release/Pulse
```

**For the double-clicked .app** (env vars do not apply, so use `defaults`):
```bash
defaults write xyz.agle.pulse LineGap 12
defaults write xyz.agle.pulse FontSize 9
# To apply: quit and relaunch the app
```

Preview just the display appearance as a PNG:
```bash
CLAUDE_USAGE_LINE_GAP=12 ./.build/release/Pulse --render /tmp/preview.png
open /tmp/preview.png
```

## Requirements

macOS 13+, Swift 6 / Xcode command-line tools.
